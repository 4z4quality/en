                <br><br>Welcome to the <span class="colored-text">4Z-Pedia</span>. Let's learn about quality accreditation of educational institutions. Many countries consider education as a component of its national security. Education is what raises the leaders of the society, its scholars, its protectors, its doctors, ....<br>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
                <br><h2>What is Educational Accreditation:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <br><li><span class="colored-text">Educational accreditation</span> is the process of evaluation and verification of the quality of services and operations of any educational institution or program by an external body, in order to determine whether applicable and recognized standards are met. If standards are fulfilled, accreditation is granted.</li>
                        <li>To be <span class="colored-text">accredited</span>, schools or universities must undertake an extensive process that requires them to successfully pass quality indicators as: manage accurate institutional data, design high-standard courses, carry out periodical assessments to evaluate & enhance performance of students, provide top-level facilities, teaching aids, etc.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Educational accreditation</span> is performed in most countries by a governmental organization, usually the Ministry of Education.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="colored-text">US</span>, the government delegates instead the accreditation to private non-profit organizations (accreditors), all accreditors in the US must in turn be recognized by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), which is a body of the U.S. Ministry of Education. That means that also in the US, accreditation is indirectly controlled by the government.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="colored-text"><br><br><font size="+2">“Quality doesn't come randomly, it's an organized effort, a thoughtful planning, and a commitment to continuous improvement.”</span></font></p>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
                <br><h2>Purposes of Accreditation:</h2>

                        <li><span class="colored-text">Planning and Improvement</span>: Accredited Units are encouraged to plan, where needed, for change and for improving the learning environment.

                    <ol>
                        <br><li><span class="colored-text">Self-assessment</span>: The institution that seeks an accreditation, should perform a self-assessment to its operational processes according to the relevant local or international standards. This can be done by their own staff, or with the help of an external quality consulting agency.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Application for accreditation</span>: The institution applies for accreditation and signs an agreement with the accrediting body.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Eligibility for accreditation</span>: The accrediting body examines documents sent by the institution (proof of compliance to the educational standards set forth by the accreditation body), and a review report is sent back to the institution.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Site-visit</span>: The accrediting body assign reviewers (number of reviewers varies according to the size of the institution and number of programs), then, a visit schedule is set up in coordination with the institution. Site-visit is executed, in which, interviews are conducted with students and staff, facilities and equipment are inspected, and documents are examined.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Review report</span>: After the site-visit, reviewers submit an initial report draft, that will be verified by consultants. Then, a copy with improvement recommendations, if any, is sent to the institution.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Accreditation decision</span>: Final report to recommend accreditation, if the institution fulfils the requirement is issued, the accreditation status of the institution is then announced.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Periodic follow-up</span>: The institution prepares an annual report on its status and efforts made to implement any recommendations of the accrediting body. Subsequently, the accrediting body examines the report, make a site-visit to the institution (if needed), and issues a follow-up report and send it to the institution. This ensures that the institution continue to adhere to high standards after initially earning accreditation.</li>
