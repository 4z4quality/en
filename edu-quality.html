            <br><br>Welcome to the <span class="colored-text">4Z-Pedia</span>. Many countries consider education as a part of its national security. Education is what raises the leaders of the society, its scholars, protectors, teachers, doctors, engineers, etc. So, let's learn more about accreditation of educational institutions, that ensures quality education for every individual in the society<br>
            <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
            <br><h2>What is the Educational Accreditation:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <br><li><span class="colored-text">Educational accreditation</span> is the process of evaluation and verification of the quality of services and operations of any educational institution, or program by an external body. In order to determine whether applicable and recognized standards are met. If standards are fulfilled, accreditation is granted.</li>
                    <li>To be <span class="colored-text">accredited</span>, schools, institutes or universities must undertake an extensive process that requires them to successfully pass quality indicators as: manage accurate data, design high-standard courses, carry out periodical assessments to evaluate and enhance performance of students, provide top-level facilities, teaching aids, etc.</li>
                    <li><span class="colored-text">Educational accreditation</span> is performed in most countries by a governmental organization, usually the ministry of education.</li>
                    <li>In <span class="colored-text">USA</span>, the government delegates instead the accreditation to private, non-profit organizations (accreditors), all accreditors in USA must in turn be recognized by the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity (NACIQI), which is a body of the U.S. ministry of education. That means that also in the US, accreditation is indirectly controlled by the government.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align:center"><span class="colored-text"><br><br><font size="+2">“Quality doesn't come randomly. It's an organized effort, a thoughtful planning, and a commitment to continuous improvement. <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a> knows this well, and this is the essence of what it offers to its valued customers.”</span></font></p>

                <ol>
                    <br><li><span class="colored-text">Self-assessment</span>: the institution that seeks an accreditation, should perform a self-assessment to its operational processes according to the relevant local or international standards. This can be done by their own staff, or with the help of an external quality consulting agency, like <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a></li>
                    <li><span class="colored-text">Application for the accreditation</span>: the institution applies for the accreditation and signs an agreement with the accrediting body.</li>
                    <li><span class="colored-text">Eligibility verification of the accreditation</span>: the accrediting body examines documents sent by the institution (proof of compliance to the educational standards set forth by the accreditation body), and a review report is sent back to the institution.</li>

                    <li><span class="colored-text">Review report</span>: after the site-visit, reviewers submit an initial report draft, that will be verified by consultants. Then, a copy with improvement recommendations, if any, is sent to the institution.</li>
