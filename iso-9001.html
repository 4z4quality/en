                <br><br>Welcome to the <span class="colored-text">4Z-Pedia</span>. Many of us have heard about ISO certification and accreditation of some institutions and companies. Many of us have seen the distinctive ISO logo on websites and business platforms. But we may not know the way to get that renowned certification. What must be followed in order to obtain this prestigious accreditation, that refers to the high quality of products or services. Let's learn together more about the stages of implementing the ISO standards and gaining the ISO certification, here as an example for a quality management system (QMS).<br>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
                <br><br><h2>Stages of the implementation of a QMS:</h2>
                <br>Any organization want to implement a QMS must follow these steps:
                    <ol>
                        <br><li>Conducting a <span class="colored-text">GAP analysis</span>, through an objective comparison between existing state of the organization, and the requirements of QMS standards. This analysis is usually conducted by specialists, as ours in <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a>, in cooperation with the employees of the organization. It uses various tools, including “<span class="colored-text">audits</span>”, “<span class="colored-text">personal interviews</span>”, or “<span class="colored-text">questionnaires</span>.” Ultimately, a conclusion is obtained about how far or close the organization is, from desired performance. The most important main output of this analysis, is an accurate identification of potential or real gaps, between the existing system in the organization and the target QMS.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="colored-text">higher management</span> of the organization, in cooperation of specialists, develop an executive <span class="colored-text">action plan</span> for the steps and procedures necessary to fill in that <span class="colored-text">gap</span> that was identified in the first step.</li>
                        <li>In parallel, the organization must adopt and implement a <span class="colored-text">training program</span> for all employees of the organization, to raise <span class="colored-text">awareness</span> of the requirements of the desired <span class="colored-text">QMS</span>, in order to prepare the organization psychologically and technically for the required change. We at <a title="4Z official Website" href="https://the4z.com/">4Z for Quality</a>, offer excellent workshops and training programs that completely change attitudes at work, foster commitment to improvement, make ISO terms easy, and establish quality principles as a culture within your organization.</li>
                        <li>The executive <span class="colored-text">action plan</span> set in the second step, is implemented through employees and experts. The organization's upper management must provide necessary <span class="colored-text">resources</span> to implement this plan.</li>
                        <li>After implementing that plan, which is supposed to comply with <span class="colored-text">QMS</span> standards, and after a reasonable period of time, confirming the stability of the new system, the higher management of the organization assigns specialists with appropriate experience, whether from <span class="colored-text">within</span> the organization or from <span class="colored-text">outside</span>, to conduct a comprehensive <span class="colored-text">audit</span> for the implementation of the new system, this audit is usually done systematically, according to a pre-established plan, and using a list known as the <span class="colored-text">check-list</span>, which includes main elements of the QMS standards, and the report is either confirming the <span class="colored-text">conformity</span>, or the <span class="colored-text">non-conformity</span> to the standards.</li>
                        <li>Results of <span class="colored-text">audits</span> are usually either "<span class="colored-text">conformance</span>" to requirements of the standards, or "<span class="colored-text">non-conformance</span>" to requirements of the standards of the desired QMS, and here appropriate corrective actions must be taken to <span class="colored-text">clear</span> "non-conformities", with the assistance of higher management of the organization.</li>
                        <li>The organization implements processes mentioned in the <span class="colored-text">fifth</span> and <span class="colored-text">sixth</span> steps on a regular basis, in order to maintain a satisfactory <span class="colored-text">performance</span> level for the organization, and in accordance with <span class="colored-text">requirements</span> of the QMS.</li>
                    </ol>
            <span class="border-line2"></span>
            <p style="text-align:center"><span class="colored-text"><br><br><font size="+2">“Implementing a QMS includes, conducting a GAP analysis, putting an action plan to address the gap, designing a training program to prepare for the change, executing the action plan, performing an audit for the new system, suggesting a corrective action to remove non-conformities.”</span></font></p>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
            <br><h2>ISO 9001 certification for the QMS:</h2>
            <br>The international standard, <span class="colored-text">ISO 9001</span>, in its latest version of <span class="colored-text">2015</span>, represents general requirements for a <span class="colored-text">QMS</span>, which are suitable for implementation to any organization, whatever its type, size, or form. ISO standards are subject to periodic amendments by the international organization for standards. When successfully qualified, any organization can obtain a <span class="colored-text">certificate</span> confirming its commitment to the standards.
            <br><span class="border-line2"></span><br>
            <h2>Accreditation Steps for ISO 9001:</h2>
            <br>Above-mentioned steps generally represent basic steps for qualifying the organization to obtain the ISO <span class="colored-text">certificate</span>. Remains to mention some important details of the accreditation process:
                    <ol>
                            <br><li>Upper management assigns a <span class="colored-text">representative</span>, who will have power and authority to establish the QMS, follow it up, and communicate with external parties regarding the system. Then, <span class="colored-text">GAP analysis</span>, in accordance with ISO 9001 standards, is immediately started, and upon completion, a <span class="colored-text">report</span> that describes current state, and defines the gap between current performance and the desired performance is issued. The report is accompanied by an <span class="colored-text">action plan</span> to remedy the gap identified in the Analysis.</li>
                            <li>Initiating and executing a <span class="colored-text">training program</span> for all employees about the QMS according to ISO 9001 standards.</li>
                            <li>Implementing the <span class="colored-text">action plan</span>, finalizing <span class="colored-text">documents</span>, and modifying all operations of the organization to conform to <span class="colored-text">ISO 9001</span> standards.</li>
                            <li>Conducting an <span class="colored-text">internal audit</span>, detecting <span class="colored-text">non-conformities</span>, and correcting them through planned <span class="colored-text">corrective actions</span>.</li>
                            <li>Upper management carry out planned periodic<span class="colored-text"> reviews</span> and follow-ups, in which the organization’s implementation of the established system is monitored, and any outstanding problems that prevent implementation or proper practice are resolved, in order to assure of the organization’s <span class="colored-text">compliance</span> with the QMS and its requirements contained in the ISO 9001 specification.</li>
                            <li>The organization, through its management representative, selects and contracts with a recognized <span class="colored-text">certifying body</span>, and arranges audit and <span class="colored-text">inspection</span> dates.</li>
                            <li>Finally, ISO certifying body audits the organization. If the <span class="colored-text">audit</span> is positive, the organization is granted the ISO 9001 certificate, provided that the organization is subject to periodic audits by the certifying body, to ensure the validity of conformity of the organization to the requirements of international standards.</li>  
                    </ol>
