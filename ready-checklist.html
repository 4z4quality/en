                <br>Many people are asking how to get an ISO certification. We explained in another <a href="iso-9001.html">4Z-Pedia</a>document, the various <a href="iso-9001.html">steps of ISO 9001:2015 certification</a>. But before thinking in contacting a certifying body, it is helpful to know how close you are from the qualification to a formal ISO 9001:2015 certification.
                <br><br>We prepared the following Checklist as a guide for that purpose. Please note that this <b>checklist</b> is composed of questions and 3 possible answers.
                <br><br><b>Questions</b> are based on the clauses of the international ISO 9001:2015 standard. They cover both <b>mandatory</b> and <b>commonly used</b> clauses required by any ISO certifying body.
                <br><br>Answers are divided into <b>three</b> distinct categories:
                    <ol>
                        <br><li><span class="colored-text">Ready</span>: means that you can proof your fulfilment of these clauses by appropriate documentation, thereby ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Almost Ready</span>: means that you are ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body to inspect you. But you need a small support to complete the required documentation.</li>
                        <li><span class="colored-text">Not Really</span>: means that you need extensive preparation before getting ready for the visit of the external audit by the certifying body to inspect you.</li>
                    </ol>
                <br>At the end of this checklist, you will find further guidance on what to do depending on your answers.
                <br><br><h2 style="text-align:center"><span class="colored-text">“In each question you will be asked whether you think you have fulfilled the criteria of the standard. You have the choice to answer as: Ready, Almost Ready, or Not Really”</span></h2>
                <br><span class="border-line2"></span>
